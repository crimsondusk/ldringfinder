// it finds an intermediate radius (ceil of the ring number times scale) and
// splits the radius at this point, calling this function again to try find the
// rings between r0 - r and r - r1.
//
// This does not always yield into usable results. If at some point r == r0 or
// r == r1, there is no hope of finding the rings, at least with this algorithm,
// as it would fall into an infinite recursion.
